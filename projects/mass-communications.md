I built a website for Jody Kotkin, a coworker and mentor of mine, to better promote her freelance communications business.

For this site, I took the client’s input on color choices and design input and built out a visually appealing design for each of the four pages on the site. I used a mix of components available through the Divi theme’s library and components I coded myself in HTML and CSS to convey information in a memorable way to users.

## Technologies Used

- WordPress
- The [Divi theme](https://www.elegantthemes.com/)
- CSS, including Grid, transitions, and `clip-path`

## Things I learned

- You can make enticing animations with relatively simple CSS. By using position: absolute, overflow: hidden, and transition: translate, I was able to make a visually engaging set of animations to display Jody’s available services.
- Sometimes, working with fewer pages can be more challenging. Rather than using a separate page for testimonials, I worked through a few different ways to display long testimonials on the homepage, finally settling on a simple grid with cards and drop-shadow.
- It can be challenging to write about and market yourself! Writing my own bio to include on the site wasn’t easy, but I was able to concisely talk about myself, my skills, and my interests.
