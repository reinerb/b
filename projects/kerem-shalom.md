I built a new WordPress site for Kerem Shalom, a local synagogue.

Together with a communications specialist and a team of dedicated volunteers from the congregation, including a graphic design professional, I developed a website design that prioritized user-friendliness while effectively presenting all the required information. I advised on site layout and content to create an effective marketing site. I then implemented that design, using built-in WordPress and Divi theme tools and CSS when necessary.

I used CSS to modify a number of the Divi theme’s default elements. The most major changes were to the Blog module’s display on the homepage, making the featured image display on the left side and adjusting the summary and titles to match. I also wrote a simple JavaScript function to hide and show a long staff bio.

## Technologies Used

- WordPress
- The [Divi theme](https://www.elegantthemes.com/)
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Things I learned

- Working with this graphic design professional helped me tighten up my understanding of UI design, specifically when it comes to choosing colors for interface elements.
- It is possible to make sweeping changes to Divi elements with only CSS, as I did with the blog module on the homepage.
