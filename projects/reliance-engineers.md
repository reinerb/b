I built a marketing website for Reliance Engineers, a small but influential civil engineering firm.

I collaborated with a communications specialist and a graphic designer to put together a compelling landing page, and created pages that effectively conveyed all of the information that the client needed. I used Divi’s template builder to build several page templates, including one that uses WordPress’s featured image and custom fields to uniformly display each employee’s bio page.

I took advantage of WordPress’s blog infrastructure to create a categorized and searchable index of their projects.

## Technologies Used

- WordPress
- The [Divi theme](https://www.elegantthemes.com/)
- CSS

## Things I learned

- While the class names can be wonky, it is easy enough to use CSS to make major adjustments to Divi’s components.
- I am capable of doing intuitive graphic and UI design on my own, but having a graphic designer involved in the process makes it much easier.
