I worked with a private tutor to establish a website.

I worked with the client to select an appealing color scheme and design a simple but effective set of pages. I designed and built pages using components from the Divi library, as well as a component built with HTML and CSS to resemble a flipping flashcard, to display information in a compelling (and thematic) way.

## Technologies Used

- WordPress
- The [Divi theme](https://www.elegantthemes.com/)
- CSS, including transitions

## Things I learned

- The `backface-visibility: hidden` CSS property, along with `transform: rotateX` or `transform: rotateY`, make animated cards easy to code.
